Customer Clustering Project
This is my first attempt with clustering techniques for customer data analysis. The project segregates customers into distinct clusters based on their pattern of expenditure and income. This would establish a pattern in customer behavior that would support business decisions.

Key Steps:
Data Preparation: Cleansed and prepared the data in Question for analysis.
K-Means Clustering: After that, the K-Means algorithm was applied to clearly make clusters for the customers into clusters.
Choosing the Right Number of Clusters: Used the "elbow method" to choose the best number of clusters.
Visualization of Results: The following plot is used to visualize how customers are clustered across clusters.

Tools used:
Pandas: Manipulate and explore the data.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: The code will be used to plot graphs and view the clusters.
scikit-learn: For K-Means clustering.

How to Use:
Clone the repository to your computer.
Install the required Python libraries with:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open the Project_1.ipynb Notebook associated with this project to see the analysis and results.
You can run the notebook to see how the clustering works, or you can try it with your own data.

Results:
The final results will be saved into a file called Clustering.csv, which includes the original customer data with the cluster assignment for each customer.
