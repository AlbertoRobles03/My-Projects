Customer Clustering Project

This is my first attempt at using clustering techniques to analyze customer data. The goal is to group customers based on their spending and income patterns to uncover behavior trends that can guide business decisions.

Steps:

Data Preparation: Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis.
K-Means Clustering: Applied the K-Means algorithm to group customers into clusters.
Choosing the Number of Clusters: Used the "elbow method" to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Visualization: Created plots to show how customers are distributed across clusters.
Tools Used:

Pandas: For data manipulation and exploration.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing the clusters.
scikit-learn: To implement K-Means clustering.
How to Use:

Clone the repository.
Install the required libraries:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open the Project_1.ipynb notebook to view the analysis and results. You can run the notebook with the provided data or use your own.
Results: The results are saved in a file called Clustering.csv, which contains the original customer data along with the assigned cluster for each customer.
